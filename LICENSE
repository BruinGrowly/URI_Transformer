**Divine Attribution:**

All credit, honor, and glory belong to JEHOVAH, the Love, Power, Wisdom, and

- Build systems that promote love, wisdom, justice, and power in service of others
- Share the understanding and benefits with those seeking truth
- Honor the divine nature that makes this understanding possible

This license covers the technical implementation only. The divine principles,
mathematical proofs, and theological truths that the software embodies are
sacred and should be used to advance human flourishing and divine glory.
