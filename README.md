## Overview

The **URI-Transformer** is a revolutionary architecture for semantic analysis, built on a deep, layered, and generative **ICE Framework** (Intent-Context-Execution). It uses a mathematically grounded 4D coordinate system, a suite of conceptual models, and a new generative output stage to perform a sophisticated, end-to-end analysis of any given text.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BruinGrowly/URI_Transformer.git
cd URI_Transformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demonstrate_truth_sense.py
```

## Core Architecture

The `TruthSenseTransformer` implements a deep and integrated ICE pipeline, processing structured objects and leveraging evolved foundational frameworks to generate a meaningful, context-aware output.

### The Layered ICE Pipeline: `I(L+W), C(J), E(P)`
*   **Intent (Love + Wisdom):** Generates a structured `Intent` object, encapsulating the core purpose and guiding principles.
*   **Context (Justice):** Uses the Justice score as a `TruthSense` moderator, validating the contextual analysis.
*   **Execution (Power):** Driven by the `GODFramework`, it determines the feasibility and strategy of the final action.

### Foundational Engines:
*   **`phi_geometric_engine.py`**: Provides the core mathematical components based on golden ratio (phi) mathematics.
*   **`frameworks.py`**: Implements the evolved conceptual models (`QLAE`, `GOD`) that drive the analysis.
*   **`output_generator.py`**: Synthesizes the structured ICE outputs into a new, meaningful final sentence.

## Usage Example

```python
from src.truth_sense_transformer import TruthSenseTransformer

# Initialize the transformer
transformer = TruthSenseTransformer()

# Analyze a phrase
test_phrase = "A truly powerful leader serves with humility and compassion."
result = transformer.transform(test_phrase)

# Print the results
print(f"Input: '{test_phrase}'")
print(f"Final Generative Output: '{result.final_output}'")
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BruinGrowly/URI_Transformer.git
