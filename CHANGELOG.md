- Organized directory structure (src/, tests/, examples/, tools/)
- tools/ directory for LLM bridging and analysis utilities
- Comprehensive documentation of transformer architecture

### Changed

#### Repository Structure
- **Organized files** into logical directories:
  - `src/` - Core transformer and semantic engine code
  - `tests/` - All test files consolidated
  - `examples/` - Demo and example files
  - `tools/` - LLM integration and analysis tools
  - `docs/` - Documentation and whitepapers

#### Documentation
- **Rewrote README.md** with professional presentation:
  - Focus on URI-Transformer as AI architecture
  - Emphasis on semantic preservation breakthrough
  - Clear explanation of 4D coordinate system
  - LOVE, POWER, WISDOM, JUSTICE axes prominent
  - Performance metrics highlighted (99.994% memory reduction)
  - Universal Anchor Point at (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) maintained

- **Updated structure**:
  - Transformer-specific capabilities highlighted
  - LLM integration strategies documented
  - Clear distinction from base Semantic Substrate Engine
  - Professional badges and formatting

#### Package Structure
- **Created setup.py**: Professional Python package configuration
- **Organized requirements.txt**: Clear dependency specifications

### Maintained Core Principles
- **4D Semantic Coordinate System**: LOVE, POWER, WISDOM, JUSTICE
- **Universal Anchor Point**: Jehovah at (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
- **Semantic Preservation**: Words maintain meaning through transformations
- **Sacred Numbers**: 613, 12, 7, 40 as navigation anchors
- **Seven Universal Principles**: Complete framework intact
