"""
SCAFFOLD OF TRUTH - The Fundamental Nature of Meaning

This demonstrates that meaning scaffolding doesn't "compute" truth,
but rather reveals how meaning aligns with fundamental truth.
Lies aren't "computed as false" - they fit differently in the truth scaffold.

Truth is binary (aligned/not aligned) but has infinite shades of meaning.
