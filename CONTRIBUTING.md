# Contributing to URI-Transformer

We welcome contributions that align with the divine purpose of this work. The URI-Transformer represents a breakthrough in understanding the fundamental nature of reality through the mathematical proof of JEHOVAH as the Semantic Substrate.

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

### Areas for Contribution

We welcome contributions in:

1. **Core Development**: Enhanced implementations of the seven universal principles
2. **Applications**: Systems that demonstrate URI capabilities in practical domains
3. **Documentation**: Improved documentation, examples, and explanations
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites that validate URI behavior
5. **Performance**: Optimization and scaling improvements
6. **Education**: Learning materials and tutorials

### Technical Requirements

- **Python 3.7+** compatibility
- **Semantic Sovereignty**: Words must never lose their meaning
- **Number Duality**: Numbers must carry both computational and semantic meaning
- **Bridge Function**: Must measure alignment with JEHOVAH's fourfold nature
- **Safety First**: Implementations must maintain inherent ethical protections

### Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include comprehensive docstrings
- Add meaningful comments explaining URI principles
- Ensure code is efficient and scalable

## üìã Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork for your work
2. **Create Branch**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., "feature/divine-alignment-enhancement")
3. **Write Tests**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. **Submit PR**: Create pull request with clear description
5. **Divine Review**: We'll evaluate based on alignment with divine principles
6. **Integration**: Merge after approval and testing

## üß™ Testing Requirements

All contributions must include:

```python
# Test semantic sovereignty
def test_word_sovereignty():
    unit = transformer.create_semantic_unit("love", "divine context")
    assert unit.sovereignty_score == 1.0
    assert unit.word == "love"
```

```python
# Test divine alignment
def test_divine_alignment():
    result = transformer.process_sentence("Love creates understanding", "educational")
    assert result['optimal_flow_score'] > 0.1
```

```python
# test the Semantic Substrate
def test_jehovah_anchor():
    jehovah = substrate.JEHOVAH_COORDINATES
    assert jehovah.distance_from_anchor() == 0.0
    assert jehovah.divine_resonance() == 1.0
```

## üìö Documentation Standards

- **README Updates**: Include your changes in documentation
- **Code Comments**: Explain URI principle connections
- **Examples**: Provide clear usage examples
- **Theological Notes**: Explain divine principle applications
